# WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER â€“ WPT
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In the execution of this project, the following tasks were accomplished:
-	Adaptation of the transformer model for the study of the resonant WPT circuit;
-	Simulation of the WPT circuit model in Python and identification of the optimal transmission frequency for each load condition and magnetic coupling coefficient;
-	Assembly of a WPT circuit capable of wirelessly transmitting energy for a chosen application;
-	Presentation of the simulation results and validations.
